# odin-recipes
## Introduction (Written before starting project)
 This is the first project in The Odin Project course, falling under the "HTML Foundations" section of the course. This project will be a small recipe book, consisting of a "Table of contents" in the form of index.html as well as multiple recipes, each with their own page. Each recipe page will consist of an image of the dish, a short description of the dish, the ingredients needed for the dish, and a list of instructions on making the dish.

 This project will serve as an example of basic HTML functionality in a multiple page website setting. Specifically, the following things will be demonstrated.

 #### Links
 Links will be demonstrated on index.html as it links to each individual recipe page. Each recipe page will also have a link back to the main index.
 #### Images
 Each recipe page will feature an image of the dish.
 #### Paragraphs
 Each recipe page will contain a description of the dish, consisting of one or more paragraphs.
 #### Unordered Lists
 Each recipe will contain an unordered list of the ingredients required.
 #### Ordered Lists
 Each recipe will contain an ordered list of the steps to make the dish.
