# odin-recipes
## Introduction (Written before starting project)
 This is the first project in The Odin Project course, falling under the "HTML Foundations" section of the course. This project will be a small recipe book, consisting of a "Table of contents" in the form of index.html as well as multiple recipes, each with their own page. Each recipe page will consist of an image of the dish, a short description of the dish, the ingredients needed for the dish, and a list of instructions on making the dish.

 This project will serve as an example of basic HTML functionality in a multiple page website setting. Specifically, the following things will be demonstrated.

 #### Links
 Links will be demonstrated on index.html as it links to each individual recipe page. Each recipe page will also have a link back to the main index.
 #### Images
 Each recipe page will feature an image of the dish.
 #### Paragraphs
 Each recipe page will contain a description of the dish, consisting of one or more paragraphs.
 #### Unordered Lists
 Each recipe will contain an unordered list of the ingredients required.
 #### Ordered Lists
 Each recipe will contain an ordered list of the steps to make the dish.
## Post Project Notes
This was a nice, simple intro project to some of the basics of HTML. Being that I already have a good grasp on some HTML and web design, there wasn't much for me to learn from the project. But it was a good way to actually "produce" something.

As I look back through the recipe pages, one thing I do see that I learned was that in order to maintain aspect ratio of an image, you can simply specify either the height or width in the style portion of the img tag, and it will scale the other dimension appropriately. I used to try to manually set them, so that definitely saves a step in the process.

Where I think I gained the most knowledge from doing this project wasn't quite in HTML itself, but in the workflow of VSCode. I'd never used VSCode before, primarily using vim for any sort of production environment. I decided to give VSCode a shot, given that it's what The Odin Project suggested. Of course, my first step was to install the vim plugin for it, so I could use a lot of the commands that have become second nature to me. That, coupled with the built in terminal functionality with VSCode made it a breeze to work with in exactly the way I like (a command style editor) but with some modern functionality, like being able to interact with the editor with my mouse easily and without breaking things if I just need to copy and grab something quick. On top of that, it's great being able to just pop down to the built-in terminal quick (which even supports panes, which is great!) to run a quick command, like a quick `git add .`, or even quickly and easily opening a file by just running `code <filename>`.
