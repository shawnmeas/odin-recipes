        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>My go to dish when it's late, and I realize I forgot to eat dinner. As much as I love good, homemade macaroni and cheese, that takes a lot of effort. And sometimes, I'm just craving the flavor of Kraft Mac and Cheese instead.</p>
        <p>This is another one of those recipes that takes something simple that is good on its own right, and just elevates it by adding more. A little bit of bacon for some extra flavor. Some extra cheese for some more gooey cheesy goodness. A few seasonings for some extra notes. And some hot sauce to give just a little kick.</p>
        <p>A warning though. There's a lot of butter and cheese in this. Probably not great for the heart!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 box Kraft Mac and Cheese</li>
            <li>6 cups water</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tsp. salt</li>
            <li>8 tbsp. butter</li>
            <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 cup bacon bits</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded mozzerella cheese</li>
            <li>1 tsp. smoked paprika</li>
            <li>1 tsp. garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 tbsp. Frank's Original Cayenne Pepper Sauce</li>
        </ul>

            <li>Add cheese powder from packet to saucepan, along with butter, bacon bits, mozzerella cheese, smoked paprika, garlic powder, and hot sauce.</li>
            <li>Combine slightly, and let sit for 1 minute until butter and cheese have melted.</li>
            <li>Add milk and mix until cheese powder has formed "sauce".</li>
