        <h1>Easy Measy Jambalaya</h1>

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is my go-to dish when I want something spicy and smokey flavored, that will leave me with plenty of leftovers throughout the week. If I was a bit more "organized" in my meal planning, this would be a great recipe to use for some meal prep.</p>
        <p>The base of this dish is a box of Zatarain's Jambalaya rice, with some Andouille sausage and chicken added. My dad first introduced me to this when I was 13 or 14, and I thought it was <strong>AWFUL</strong>. A few years later I tried it again, and loved it. It quickly became one of my favorite meals. Over the past 15 or so years, my preparation of it has evolved. What originally started as just a simple meal has led to one where I add in quite a few extra seasonings for flavor. Usually when I make it, I use a family sized box of Zatarain's Jambalaya which makes 6 servings, so there's <strong>PLENTY</strong> leftover for the week ahead.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Family Box of Zatarain's Jambalaya</li>
            <li>2 lbs boneless skinless chicken breast</li>
            <li>2 lbs Andouille sausage</li>
            <li>4 cups water</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tbsp. smoked paprika</li>
            <li>1 tbsp. garlic powder</li>
            <li>Old Bay Seasoning</li>
            <li>Frank's Original Cayenne Pepper Sauce</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Clean and prepare chicken. Cut to appropriately sized cubes/strips.</li>
